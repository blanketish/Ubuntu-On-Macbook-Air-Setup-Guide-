PERSONAL SETUP 

1) INSTALL KEYD (linux system wide keyboard remapper) AND APPLY CUSTOM CONFIG

            - Left Control key will function as the Super/Windows key
            - Left Command key will function as the Left Control key
            - Left Option key will function as the Alt key
            - Caps Lock will function as Control when held and Escape when tapped
            - The Escape key will function as Caps Lock

Custom keyd terms: 
            - Command key is referred to as "meta"
            - Option key is referred to as "alt"

STEPS TO INSTALLING: 

a. Install keyd using the PPA provided. 
   ```
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:keyd-team/ppa
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install keyd
   ```

b. Start and enable keyd:
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable keyd
   sudo systemctl start keyd
   ```

c. Create a configuration file:
   Create a new file at `/etc/keyd/default.conf` using a text editor with sudo privileges. For example:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/keyd/default.conf
   ```

d. Add the following configuration to the file:

   ```
   [ids]

   *

   [main]

   # Remap left control to super (Windows key)
   leftcontrol = layer(super)

   # Remap left command to left control
   leftmeta = layer(control)

   # Remap left option to alt
   leftalt = layer(alt)

   # Remap capslock to control when held, escape when tapped
   capslock = overload(control, esc)

   # Remap escape to capslock
   esc = capslock
   ```

2) Install facetimehd driver support: 

1. Open a terminal.

2. Clone the firmware repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/patjak/facetimehd-firmware.git
   ```

3. Change into the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd facetimehd-firmware
   ```

4. Run make as root to extract the firmware:
   ```
   sudo make
   ```

5. Install the firmware:
   ```
   sudo make install
   ```

6. Clone the driver repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/patjak/bcwc_pcie.git
   ```

7. Change into the driver directory:
   ```
   cd bcwc_pcie
   ```

8. Build the kernel module:
   ```
   make
   ```

9. Install the kernel module:
   ```
   sudo make install
   ```

10. Run depmod to update module dependencies:
    ```
    sudo depmod
    ```

11. Load the kernel module:
    ```
    sudo modprobe facetimehd
    ```

12. Reboot your system to ensure all changes take effect:
    ```
    sudo reboot
    ```

After rebooting, your FaceTime HD camera should be working. You can test it using a application like Cheese or by running:
```
mplayer tv://
```

If you encounter any issues with Cheese showing a corrupted image, try changing the resolution in Cheese settings to a lower value, then turn your computer off and on again (not just reboot).

Since you're using Wayland on Ubuntu 24.04, most applications should work fine with the camera. However, if you encounter any issues, you may need to use Wayland-compatible applications or switch to an X11 session for testing.

Would you like me to explain or elaborate on any part of these instructions?
